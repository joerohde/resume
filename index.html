				<br /><a name="arena"></a><br/>
				<h3>Arena Allocator</h3> The arena allocator is a specialized allocator which allows for very quick
				allocation and very efficient deletion. Unfortunately, it only applies to a very rigid usage pattern.
				That pattern is that a significant number of allocations will be made, and they are rarely resized or
				deleted before the entire &lsquo;arena&rsquo; is ready to be deleted. The typical use pattern is in a
				compiler where the body of a function is parsed, used to whatever end desired, and then the entire body
				thrown out.<br />This project is written at the &lsquo;C with objects&rsquo; level.<br />The
				general arena pattern is implemented as follows:<br />
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>The arena is extended in 4K blocks. If a single item would be larger than 4K, a single block of
						that size is allocated.</li>
					<li>The 4K blocks are chained</li>
					<li>This was designed to a specific problem. If it were to be generalized the 4K would be a
						constructor parameter of the arena. An additional &lsquo;feature&rsquo; that was specific to the
						problem being solved is that the initial block is only 192 bytes instead of 4K, as it turned out
						a huge majority of my use cases profiled under this number. Those that were larger tended to be
						much larger.</li>
					<li>The allocator supports optional under/overflow checking for each allocation.</li>
					<li>The allocator supports optional usage tracking for measuring effectiveness.</li>
					<li>Can be trivially turned off to compare to regular new/delete.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>Allocation typically just an increment if a pointer offset into the arena, and a return of the
						previous pointer. Extra bookkeeping is done when crossing over the block boundary. Care is taken
						to encourage a C++ compiler to inline the common case. A special &lsquo;new&rsquo; is defined
						that takes an arena pattern. Usage looks like: CFoo *p = new (pArena) CFoo();</li>
					<li>Delete is overriden similarly in order to support the optional over/underflow buffer checking.
					</li>

				<h3>Tree with weighted random selection</h3> The original motivation for this code was that I was
				writing a touch screen media player. I wanted efficient sorted access to data via a binary tree like
				structure, but I also wanted an efficient way to randomly select songs weighted by their
				&lsquo;star&rsquo; ratings.<br />This project is written as a template collection class. It is
				kept simple in a style more common to C# or Java than to C++. The code is commented for what I would
				change to make it a bit more rugged for industrial use.<br />This algorithm works by storing extra
				data in each node of the tree. The three stored values are<br />
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>Actual song rating (immutable)</li>
					<li>Sum of songs lower in the tree</li>
					<li>Transient song rating</li>
				</ul><br />The transient song rating is initially the same as the actual song rating. If the song is
				selected, the transient rating would be left alone, dropped to zero, or cut in half based on whether the
				selector was set for &lsquo;repeat is fine&rsquo;, &lsquo;never repeat&rsquo;, or &lsquo;cut chance of
				re-selection in half&rsquo; respectively.<br />The algorithm works as follows:<br />
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>When an item is added to tree, the weight is retrieved and set in the node. When the node is
						finally placed in the tree, the &lsquo;sum&rsquo; is set to the sum of the 2 immediate
						children&rsquo;s sums and the node&rsquo;s own weight. The current node&rsquo;s weight is then
						propagated into the sums of all parents up to the root.</li>
					<li>Node rotation is aware of the weight sums, and makes the needed adjustments.</li>
					<li>Random selection is done by taking a random [Rnd] value from 0 to the weighted sum in the root.
						A current node [C] is set to the root.<ul></li>
					<li>If R is less than C&rsquo;s weight [Cw], return the node. Optionally modify the weight of C and
						propagate the that impact to the root.</li>
					<li>Else<ul></li>
					<li>Rnd = Rnd - Cw</li>
					<li>If the left child [L]&rsquo;s sum weight is less than Rnd, C = L</li>
					<li>else Rnd = Rnd - L&rsquo;s sum; C = right child</li>
					<li>Back to first step</ul></ul></li>
					<li>This implementation stores the weights/sums as int/int64, but double would have been fine, 	if not
						better if overflow is a concern.</li>
					<li>Finally: My implementation of this was destroyed several years ago, so I&rsquo;ve thrown it back
						together on Feb 6, 09. This tree is not optimized [ie: delete is still recursive] and is a
						typical implementation (re: Sedgewick). The algorithm is really about showing the random selection.
					</li>
				</ul><br />It&rsquo;s a bit easier to explain with a picture:<br />

				<h3>Minimal branch size encoding using a graph algorithm</h3> In a compiler code generator, there are
				often multiple branch instructions optimized for the distance of the jump. This is especially true in
				bytecode systems like .Net. There is often a 2 byte instruction for jumping -128/127 bytes, and a larger
				instruction for much longer jumps. The core problem is trying to know which instruction to encode when
				the span between the branch and destination contains 1 or more unresolved branch
				sources.<br />This project is written using STL, and TR1 where convenient.<br />While
				programs contain many many branch instructions, in the end they all degenerate into the following
				considerations:<br /> <img class="imageStyle" alt="SimpleArc" src="files/simplearc.png"
					width="114" height="155" /><br />In this case the encoding is simply a matter of knowing if the
				length of the jump fits in a byte.<br />Now consider another case:<br /> <img class="imageStyle"
					alt="DominatedArc" src="files/dominatedarc.png" width="143" height="274" /><br />In this example
				it&rsquo;s easy to encode A&rsquo;, but Y&rsquo; cannot be encoded until A&rsquo; is. The encoding size
				of A&rsquo; could directly impact whether or not Y&rsquo; can be encoded small. Note that the target of
				A&rsquo; does not directly impact the discussion. <br/><b>Conflicted Arcs</b><br/>This is a degenerate case. The source of A&rsquo; is contained in the arc of
				Y&rsquo;, and vice versa. It is not worth working &lsquo;hard&rsquo; to solve this case, so it is
				sufficient to go through the arcs, check if each enclosed arc will be encoded short, and if so, encode
				this one short if it can be. Do this for all cross reference arcs. If at the end there are still unbound
				arcs, just encode them all large.<br />Realistically there is a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; solution
				by just running through the branch sources:<br />
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>For each branch, if all enclosed branches will have a fixed size encoding, encode it
						appropriately taking those sizes into account.</li>
					<li>A branch&rsquo;s fixed sized encoding is determined by: if the branch can be encoded short even
						if all its enclosed branches are long, it will be short. If a branch would be long even if all
						its enclosed branches are encoded short, it will be long.</li>
					<li>Either restart since some some choices that were indeterminate may have become known, or just
						force whatever is left long.</li>
				</ul><br />While each of these cases is reasonable on its own, a real program can contain intermingling
				of the above cases . Ideally we would like a data structure that could break it down into the degenerate
				cases noted here and dealt with in the fashion of these 3 cases.<br />Consider the following graph
				structure:<br />
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>Each vertex in the graph represents a branch arc. From the last figure, there would be 2 nodes
						A&rsquo;, and C&rsquo;.</li>
					<li>Each directed edge represents an arc that spans the source of the target arc. In the last figure
						A&rsquo; and C&rsquo; would have directed edges to each other. In the middle figure, only
						Y&rsquo; would have an edge to A&rsquo;, not the other way around.</li>
				</ul>This graph is acyclic except when forms of the last figure occur.<br />This graph is
				reasonably easy to generate from a typical &lsquo;intermediate compiler format&rsquo; (IR). The IR
				typically contains markers for labels that represent the target of a branch, and the branch instructions
				themselves only target a label at this point. When forward scanning the IR whenever a new label
				&lsquo;L&rsquo; or branch to L is seen, any branch source &lsquo;S&rsquo; seen before the &lsquo;other
				end&rsquo; of L becomes a directed arc from L to S. I&rsquo;ve glossed over the fact that labels are
				often targetted more than once. This is easy to deal with either by associating a reference count for
				the label and referring the arcs as L1, L2, etc...<br />The code generating solution is to walk
				the graph and for all vertices with no outgoing edges, encode the branch; remove the vertex; repeat
				until no more vertices exist without outgoing edge. If the graph is not empty, solve the degenerate
				cases and start over. If a full iteration of these two steps does not resolve anything new, just encode
				whatever is left as long.<br />It should not require more than 1 or 2 passes to solve any but the
				most degenerate (and likely hand written) case.<br /><br /><strong>Source <br />
